// This file will be generated from the TypeScript content.tsx
// In a real build process, you'd compile the TypeScript to JavaScript
// For now, this is a placeholder that would contain the compiled content script

console.log("Bitbucket NPM Scanner content script loaded")

// The actual implementation would be the compiled version of content.tsx
// You would need to set up a build process (webpack, rollup, etc.) to compile
// the React/TypeScript code to plain JavaScript for the extension
